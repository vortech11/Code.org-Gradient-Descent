# Simple Gradient Descent algorithm

Yep. I don't know what else to say. Just read the code I guess.

This was a fun program to write. I wish it worked better though.

## How I made it:

I used objects to simulate specific agents that could reproduce and so on.

I used the canvas as a way to display things to the screen.

## Improvements in the future:

The scope control that I used was not the best

It does not work that well: it deviates (you'll see it if you run the program).

It's performance on lower end machines is not the best
